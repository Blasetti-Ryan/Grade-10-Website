        <h3 id="family"><u>#2:Family Feud</u></h3>
            <a href="http://www.familyfeud.com/"><img id="showimg" src="images/feud.png" alt="Family Feud logo"></a> 
            <p>My second favourite game show is Family Feud. This show has two teams of five contestants that make up a 
               team/family. These two teams go back and forth to attempt to guess the answers people have given to a survey. If 
               they get it right, they get points and the first to reach 300 poits gets to play the bonus round. In this bonus 
               round (called the fast-money round) contestants have 20 seconds to guess the highest answers of a survey. If they 
               reach over 200 points, they win <mark>$20,000</mark>.</p>
        <br>
            <p>This show makes it into my Best of because of the enjoyment I get from playing along. When watching this show, you 
               are not given the answers until the end. This makes it fun to watch with family or friends so you can try to guess 
               the answers before the contestants do. It is a really satisfying felling to get it right, especially the hard 
               answers. Furthermore, the host Steve Harvey is very funny and entertaining, keeping the viewer's attention.</p>

            <a href="http://www.globaltv.com/bigbrother/"><img id="showimg" src="images/big.png" alt="Big Brother logo"></a> 
            <p>My favourite game show is Big Brother. This is a game show about a bunch of people who are brought into a house and 
                sequestered from society. Their objective is to be the last one in the house. Every week, houseguests compete for 
                the head of household. This power allows them to put two people on the block. These two people plus four more 
                compete in a veto competition, and the prize can be used to take someone off of the block. At the end of the week, 
                the other houseguests vote for which of the people on the block they want to go home. Whoever recieves the most 
                votes is evicted.</p>
        <br>
            <p>This show makes it into my Best of because of the excitement. It's always interesting to watch this show because 
               the competition's are so fun and entertaining to watch. Additionally, most people will pick someone to root for and 
                it's always awesome to watch them win. The best part is watching people make alliances and then waiting to see who 
                turns on the others first. </p>

            <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-middle"><img id="showimg" src="images/middle.jpg"></a> 
            <p>My second favourite comedy show is The Middle. This show is a sitcom about a family. The family always gets into 
               arguments or comedic scenarios with one another that resolves itself at the end of the show, leaving a funny, but 
               heart warming message. The family is made up of the two parents (Frankie and Mike Heck) and three children (Sue, 
               Axl,and Brick Heck).</p>
        <br>
            <p>This show makes it into my Best of because of the comedy and relatability. This show has some witty dialogue and 
               makes everything work together smoothly which allows for easy joke setup. Additionally, it's funnier because the 
               show is so relatable to the life of my family. When watching it with family it's fun to see which character is 
               most like each family member. Finally, the best part is the heartwarming message at the end that wrpas up the 
               episode. </p>

        <h3 id="impractical"><u>#1:Impractical Jokers</u></h3>
            <a href="http://www.trutv.com/shows/impractical-jokers/index.html"><img id="showimg" src="images/joker.png"></a> 
            <p>My favourite comedy show is Impractical Jokers. This show is about four guys (named Q, Murr, Sal, and Joe) who set 
               tasks that they all compete in. These tasks usually include doing difficult or embarassing things to the public 
               that do not know about it. The person that fails gets a loss and at the end of the show, the person with the most 
               losses faces an ultimate punsihment.</p>
        <br>
            <p>This show makes it into my Best of because of the tasks. In this show, the tasks that they must complete usually 
               create funny situations since the public does not know it is only for a televsion show. In some scenarios, they get 
               scared they may get hurt by someone. In conclusion, the ultimate punsihments are the funniest things to watch.</p>
