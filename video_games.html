            alt="Titanfall Image"></a>
            <p>My fifth favourite video game is Titanfall. This game is a first person-shooter that incorporates fast and erratic 
               movement to defeat other online players. There are a variety of guns and wepaons to choose from, and, once you do 
               well enough you can call in a titan which is an awesome, giant, mech that you can use to kill other players.</p>
        <br>
            <p>This video game makes it into my Best of because of the fun, fast-paced gameplay along with the addition of giant 
                mechs. This was the first game I ever reached the max prestige in. The gameplay allows for quick 
                movement/decisions that could skillfuly be used to defeat foes. It's also awesome to use the titans and feel 
                invincible. I would suggest this game to fans of shooting games. </p>

            alt="Atlas Reactor Image"></a>
            <p>My fouth favourite video game is Atlas reactor. This game is a real-time strategy MOBA. It incorporates a chess-
               style grid movement system in which all players input their attacks before various phases. There is a short time 
               limit to make all decisions so not only must one decide wisely, but they must decide quickly as well. The objective 
               is to be the first team to reach five kills in a 4v4 match. </p>
        <br>
            <p>This video game makes it into my Best of because of the amount of strategy required. Not only does one have to 
               think about which move is most effective, but, one must take in to account the movements of other players to 
               predict where they will be to hit them. Additionally, the character design is amazing and the game is even free to 
               play.</p>

            alt="Borderlands 2 Image"></a>
            <p>My third favourite video game is Borderlands 2. This game is a first-person shooter that can be played co-
               operatively online. It also follows an RPG system in which loot can be found and the character can be levelled up 
               to gain new abilities and get stronger. The objective is to complete the storyline by fighting bosses until you 
               reach the end of the game. </p>
        <br>
            <p>This video game makes it into my Best of because of the fun and comedic gameplay. This game is really fun because 
               it feels like a shooter should where you can destroy opponents with ease and the weapons feel fun to fire. The 
               large variety of weapons and abilities give it good replay value as well. Finally, the dialogue is the funniest in 
               any video game. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and cracks jokes to improve the game.</p>

            <a href="http://www.thelastofus.playstation.com/index.html"><img id="movieimg" src="images/us.jpg" 
             alt="The Last of Us Image"></a>
            <p>My second favourite video game is The Last of Us. This game is a third-person survival/horror game. The story 
               involves a type of zombie infection that is thought to be cureless until your character finds somene that is 
               supossedly immune. The objective of the game is to kill the infected on the way to bringing the person that is 
               immune to the end of the game. The gameplay involves limited ammunition and a lot of crafting with parts found in 
               the game. </p>
        <br>
            <p>This video game makes it into my Best of because of the immersive story and gameplay. The story is very sad and 
               pulls in the play with the well designed environment to match the mood of the game. Furthermore, as you progress 
               the story gets more grim as more information is given into the background of the characters. Not to mention, the 
               survival gameplay adds a fun difficulty to the game.</p>

         <h3 id="league"><u>#1:League of Legends</u></h3>
            <a href="http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/"><img id="movieimg" src="images/legend.jpg" 
              alt="League of Legends Image"></a>
            <p><strong>My favourite video game of all time is: </strong><em>League of Legends</em>. League of Legends is a team-
                oriented MOBA strategy game. It involves two teams fighting to be the winner on a battlefield called Summoner's 
                Rift. The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy Nexus. The crystal in their base is called the Nexus. This 
                is done by choosing a champion and fighting an enemy team until you have destroyed all turrets. Then, one can 
                attack and destroy the Nexus to win the game.</p>
        <br>
            <p>This video game makes it into my Best of because of the fun gameplay and due to my friends. This game is fun to      
               play because the gameplay is easy to learn and it is fun to advance in skill to outplay your oppnents. Another 
               factor to add fun to the game is by playing with your friends. It's a great way to increase the fun by working 
               with them to win. I like this the best because all my friends can play it. </p>
